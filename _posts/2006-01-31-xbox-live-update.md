Yesterday Microsoft announced the first update to the 360 dashboard. According to Microsoft:
This free Xbox 360 update is great news! We’ve been listening to what the community has been telling us, so we’re happy to announce that this update will improve your gaming experience.
Here are some of the changes in this update:
    * Improvements to the Xbox Guide.
    * Option to retain your saved games when you delete a profile.
    * Increased accuracy of “last time played.”
    * Network configuration improvements for Xbox Live® members in the Netherlands.
    * More detailed messaging for unreadable disk or region errors.
This free update is available to all Xbox Live members. Your console will be updated the next time you sign in to Xbox Live.

However there is strong belief that the update also patches the recent exploit in kiosk disc’s. No sign of an update allowing you to carry on browsing the marketplace whilst downloading, also not much on the horizon about game updates. Thanks Microsoft but keep on working at it
