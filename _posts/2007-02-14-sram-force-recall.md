Rob called me this morning to let me know that he got wind of a recall notice on all SRAM Force brakesets.
Apparently the titanium used in the mounting bolts is not right which can lead to failure of the unit, I checked the SRAM website and yes everything is going back.
Just take a wild guess as to what brakes I’m fitting on my stealth project (more details on this later) you got it; Force!Oh well I can’t go any further until the rest of the bike has been delivered anyway.
