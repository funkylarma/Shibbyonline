Today saw the first bit of sunshine in quite a while. So much so I put on my shorts and tee and decided to take a quick trip down the tracks around here. It was still wet under the trees but it was nice to feel the sun on my back. So much so I suggested to Lucy that we hit the road for a bit. It was the first time Lucy had riden her new bike for any distance but the sun really does it justice.
