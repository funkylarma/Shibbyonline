This morning I had to take a quick trip into Ipswich and the results where some what preplexing. It has been a little over a week since the incidents started happening in and arround Ipswich and even with two people in custody there is a strange feeling to the place. Police cars are still surrounding the Portman Road/Portman Walk area and as you drive along you realise just how present the Police are. Luckly my trip did not take me towards the London Road area, where there is a lot of activity at present. What ever the outcome it has put a permanent scar on Ipswich and it does chill the blood to know that something like this happens, you see it in films or on television but to have it on your doorstep really put it into perspective.
