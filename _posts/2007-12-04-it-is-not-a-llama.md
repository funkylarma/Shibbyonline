For a quite a while now there has been a farm of what I thought were Llama’s in the local village of Long Melford. Until one day a customer came into work and wanted some carrier bags for the produce from his Alpaca farm in Melford. I soon realised my mistake and after a conversation mentioned to him of my online presence; Funky Larma (yes he too pointed out the spelling). He suggested that I pop in with my camera and take some photo’s, using them for avatars or stuff.  Last Friday Paul popped in again for some ideas on packaging up gift certificates, interested I asked what he was planning. Turns out you can adopt an Alpaca from his flock/herd/bunch (?) and recieve updates to their progress. This was too much to pass down and so we asked if Oscar Products as a company could take part, Paul mentioned he had one male animal left to name, so we talked him into naming him Oscar. So I present Oscar the Alpaca.  If you too feel like an Alpaca adoption is just the right gift for some one act now as the adoption programe is running up until Christmas, contact Paul Rylott for more details.
