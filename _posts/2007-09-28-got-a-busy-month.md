This Monday it will be October 1st, the year feels like it is flying away. Once again this year shibbyonline will be going PinkForOctober in aid of breast cancer awareness. Given that Jacqui is back in hospital at present for further surgery it feels the right time to show some support. But thatâ€™s not all on the 15th I will also be taking part in Blog Action Day. This is an idea that multiple blogs launch a mass posting on environmental issues, I guess hoping that there is power in the masses. In the last few months I have had a thorn in my side about plastic bags and the eco-friendly brigade, I think this might be the right time to write something up on it.
