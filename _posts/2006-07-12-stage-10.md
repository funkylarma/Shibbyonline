Today the Tour de France enters the first mountain stage; stage 10. So far the race has been a strange affair, the big names are missing, the sprints seem to be at a loss and unorganised there is no team controlling the race or setting the pace. The result of all this is that it is a pretty much open board, you have had some unexpected names at the top with some very strange results. But the best performance has got to be the sprints by Robbie McEwen. Lets hope that the beginning of the mountains will provide a clearer picture as to where this race is going and force some leadership into the teams.
