After putting a few pictures on the blog from my boat trip, Mr Craft asked for a link so he could get a close up look of the pictures. This inspired me to try and sort out my .Mac Homepage. When i subscribed to .Mac, they gave me 150mb of webspace to display some of my files, photos, movies, etc. I have finally got round to putting the photos into albums and sorting them into order. Feel free to check it out at anytime, as i will keep adding until i have no more space left!!!
