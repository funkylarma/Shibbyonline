Ok it’s Friday, in fact it’s Friday evening and I really have that great feeling inside. Of course you always get that feeling when you leave work ready for the week end but there is an extra reason for my buzzy’ness… Right now Lucy should be boarding a plane in Raleigh on her way back home. It has been a slow last two weeks but I am really looking forward to seeing Lucy again, gonna be a great day tomorrow.
