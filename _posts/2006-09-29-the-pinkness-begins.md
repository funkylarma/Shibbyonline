With only a couple of days left in September I have been quietly trying to construct my pink theme for shibbyonline.
Natalie has already set the mood, a very nice version of her site; not as pink as thought it would be but the message is very clear.I have been keeping an eye on the ever growing list of sites over at Pink For October and so far I’m really looking forward to seeing people’s own version’s and take on the pink themes.
