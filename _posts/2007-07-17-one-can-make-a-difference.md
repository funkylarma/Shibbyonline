The other month I wrote aboutthe condition of the local cycle paths and more importantly the plans to change the Highway Code in respect of the use of these paths. Well I signed the petition to campaign against it and it turned out to be a fruitful exercise; check out the response
You recently signed a petition asking the Prime Minister to “Listen to cyclists and not approve the revised highway code.” The Prime Minister’s Office has responded to that petition and you can view it here: http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page12275.asp Prime Minister’s Office Petition information - http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/roads4bikes/ If you would like to opt out of receiving further mail on this or any other petitions you signed, please email optout@petitions.pm.gov.uk
Just goes to show that you can make a difference if you try, power in numbers.
