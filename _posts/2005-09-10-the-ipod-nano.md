Its looks like Apple are trying to upgrade the mini with a new colour screen version. The release of the iPod Nano takes this role nicely, with a 2GB and 4GB version with prices starting at around Â£139 direct from the Apple Store. This small new mp3 player also has the capabilities of the larger iPods for storing photos and creating slideshows for mobile displays.
The Nano will be a great accessory for those who have not got an mp3 player or who want to upgrade theirs. No wonder Walkers Crisps are giving away an iPod every five minutes, I suspect Apple have a few leftover!!
