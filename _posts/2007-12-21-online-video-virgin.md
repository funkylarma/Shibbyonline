Today Viddler took my online video virginity.
I had purchased a Sony PC5 camcorder back in 2001 and at the time took some footage but never did anything with it. Finally, 6 years on, I’ve imported the footage into iMovie and started messing about.

Quite a bit of the footage of back in my kiting days so it was a trip down memory lane as I put together a quick tour in my lessons of learning to fly a kite.

Now came the decision on where to publish my masterpiece. Of course I could follow the herd over to youtube, but I opted to venture into Viddler’s garden. Why?
Well for one my Twitter feed is always populated with Colin and his top notch Viddler publicity. But also because they are showing some promise and the future looks good for them.
