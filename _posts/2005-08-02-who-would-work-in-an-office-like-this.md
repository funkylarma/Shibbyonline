It must have been one bored board meeting the other day.
During the summer is the best time to carry out the general repairs and renovations to the work buildings and offices and this year was no exception, but the front doors needed a lick of paint. The old colour was a gloss black which when you look at them is not bad, goes with the colours of Oscar Products but some how Lyn decided that Oscar’s second primary colour should be used, creating this:
Well at least no one can say that the company is just another grey office block or factory produced magnolia dream and whilst it was a bit shocking to start with when you look at the whole picture it is not as bad as you first think.
Guess I’ll just need to keep the sunglasses on a bit longer this year, I feel sorry for Colin having to paint the doors that colour as everyone drives past.
