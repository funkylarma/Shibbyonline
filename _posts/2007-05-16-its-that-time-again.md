I logged into Flickr and noticed I had one of those little alert messages. The message was to warn me that my Pro account was about to expire. Wow, I never realised that 12 months had passed already. The Flickr Pro account is by far a great investment, at sub $25 for unlimited photo storage it is money well spent in my books. Sign me up for another year!
