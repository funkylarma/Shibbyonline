It has taken a while but finally the clan I belong to DAO have been noticed and we are being published. Thanks to Nigel (of Crafty fame) for all his hard work in sending off the emails, well basically he kept on badgering them until they had no choice to do a article on us!
As I’m not a hardcore gamer I do not get the copies of the magazines delivered to the door so I can’t tell what or where the item will be published, just have to wait and see ;)
