Today we had a bit of a family outing, to the local motorcross course to watch some action.
Sean, Sarah, Lyn, Ken, Lucy and I made the short journey to ‘Lovenly Hall’ for a event in the motorcross calendar. As you can tell I do not really follow the sport’s events, but I can’t get enough of the action.
