Ka-Meng posted a question in the binary bonsai discussion group about trying to implement a ‘Alert’ banner instead of changing code each time. On my daily cruise through the groups I noticed this and for once opted not to remain an unnamed reader and as I thought I could try and help; hmmm…
Needless to say the mod is working with help from Matt Boothby. I’m even trying it out on here, gives me an idea for an update banner as well.
If you fancy making site alerts that little bit easier drop by cause an effect and try it out.
