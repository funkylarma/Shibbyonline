I decided to give mint a try as a new way to monitor web traffic (if any).
there has been a lot of hype about mint before it’s release but you know me I’m never one to jump too soon so I held back and to be honest it has had some mixed reviews, on the whole I think it has gone down a storm with the newer blogging crowd. I think the old schoolers out there have criticised the price tag of the application and claiming that there are other alternatives out there without the outlay. true. but mint is all about ''a fresh look at your site'' and to be honest I have to agree on that one, the user interface is very crisp, clean and minty fresh really.
whether it works or not, only time will tell.
