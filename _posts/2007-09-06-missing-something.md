Look through your feeds, notice something missing?Content?
Yep I’ve been elsewhere the last few days. Understandable if you had this parked outside!It all started last week, having ordered the bike I was getting like a school boy at Christmas, I could not concentrate on anything and was turned upside down.
Finally Monday the 3rd arrived and I set off to collect my new machine. Since then I have been out and about riding my way through to the first service; I’m 115miles into the 600mile deadline.
Let’s be honest, or rather I had better be honest with myself, as long as the weather holds and the sun shines I think I will be out there improving my skills. And when not I’ll be over at the FZ6 forum catching up with other riders from around the globe.
