The last few days the East of England has been going through a mini heat wave or something. Since about Tuesday last week the weather has just been getting hotter and hotter. Today has been the best so far, to try and catch some of the sunshine I finally got Lucy out on a bike with narrow tires, just remember to take plentty of water.
