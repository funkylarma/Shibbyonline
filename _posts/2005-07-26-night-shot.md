When i was on my fore mentioned boat trip, i tried playing around with my digital camera to she what i could get. I tried silhouette, mirrored and night shots. The camera has no special self lighting system for night, it just leaves the shutter open for longer to allow more light in. Good job there was some kind of moon that night!
