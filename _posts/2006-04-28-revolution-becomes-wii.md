Unless you have had your head in the sand for a few days you are probably aware of the name change to the new Nintendo console.
The old name; Revolution, is out and up steps; Wii.
Nope you read right, Wii.
It is pronouced we rather wie and there are some good reasons behind it.
David B has a good post going on over at davidbabylon.com which details a lot of links regarding this change, also the promo video for the event. Worth a look
