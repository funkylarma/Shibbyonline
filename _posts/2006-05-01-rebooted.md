Today was the Spring 2006 reboot, finally my new theme goes live, well sort of. Drop me a vote here
It is not 100% complete, I’d say about 85% (I love making up figures) I still have some navigation links to complete. I’m not happy with the commenting and there needs to be a search feature and improved Archives but apart from that my first theme from the ground up.
