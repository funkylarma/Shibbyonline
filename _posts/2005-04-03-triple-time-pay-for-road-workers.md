We had a letter through the door the other day to claim that they would finally try and sort out the surface of the road we live on, the plan was to close the road from Sat evening through till Sunday. We did not quite expect the machinery that they bought in to do the job with. Having a tall house we manged to get a birds eye view of the whole process and have to admit Sean and I spent most of the evening just watching this machine eat the tarmac armed with bottles of Stella of course!
