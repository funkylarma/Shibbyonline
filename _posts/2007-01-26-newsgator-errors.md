Come on Newsgator I’ve been getting this error for the last couple of days now. It would appear that they have some dodgey java scripts over at the Newsgator online service which is preventing the display of feeds. Every time I load up the page it will pause, then the handy little Firefox debugger lets me know that a script is dragging it’s heels. No matter what option I pick I get the same results. The end page but no ability to mark the items as read. Pain in the ass, I now have several thousand unread articles and no way of reading them at work!
