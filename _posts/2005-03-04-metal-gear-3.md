Today was the UK release of Metal Solid 3: Snake Eater for the PlayStation2. Whilst I have aready been playing this through the use of a US copy and PS2 I think I will purchase the UK version. Rumours are there are more extras on the UK copy, a few more ‘Snake Vs. Monkey’  levels and the game setting of ‘Extreme’
