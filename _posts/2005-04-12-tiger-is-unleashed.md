It looks like the wait is over, the release date for Tiger has been confirmed. Placing a pre-order with tha Apple store will mean your copy will arrive for the 29th. Now I only have one question, do I upgrade on the day? All the nice new feaures of Tiger are appealing but can I done with the standard broken apps and corrupt permissions that are always there during a upgrade. Got a bit of time to think about it I guessâ€¦
