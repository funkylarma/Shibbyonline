I’ve that extra special Friday afternoon feeling as from now I’m on holiday for the next week.
To be honest I have nothing planned and would not have even taken the time off work if it wern’t for the fact that Dan and Adele had suggested a camping trip as they are on a factory shutdown, plus the fact that I have three weeks holiday to take before the end of the year!
On closer inspection the camping idea was a bit of a spur of the moment event, with us needing to look after Pickle and D&D needing a sitter for Augie we have sorted scrubbed out the plans, so now I have a week of just sitting back and relaxing.
