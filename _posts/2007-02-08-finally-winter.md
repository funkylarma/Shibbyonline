There have been warnings of severe weather and snow over the last 24 hours, I’m surprised there was not a mass panic with people buying up all the last Lima beans at Tesco’s; just in case. This morning I woke expecting to see a slight dusting on the ground but not much else, I was not disapointed. So in the spirit of things I decided to cycle into work, this was the best decision ever, look at the views #.
