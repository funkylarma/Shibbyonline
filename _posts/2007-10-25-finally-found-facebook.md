I think that it is the thought of my upcoming 30th Birthday; yep I’m getting old. But over the last few days I’ve finally logged onto Facebook and been searching for old friends, or sometimes just names I know! So if you get a invite from me, don’t worry it’s just some form of pre-mid-life crisis going on. Just accept it and move on, I know after Saturday I will be.
